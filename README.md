3-Click on your name icon at the top right corner and then click “Settings” to go to the settings page. 
4-Click “API” to go to the API creation page. 
5-Click “click here” under the Request an API Key section. 
6-Select “Developer” as the type of your API. 
7-Click “Accept” to agree with the terms of use of TMDB API. 
8-Fill in the application details and click “Submit”. 
9-Replace my Api key with the one you have generated, ApiKey in the application is stored in Repositories/MovieRepository
